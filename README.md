# P2-gpio-ledrgb

This exercise consists on drive a [RGB LED](https://github.com/clases-julio/p2-gpio-ledrgb-dgarciac2021/wiki/RGB-LED) with the [GPIO](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021/wiki/GPIO) available on the [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021/wiki/Raspberry-Pi#raspberry-pi-3b). You might want to take a look on the [wiki](https://github.com/clases-julio/p2-gpio-ledrgb-dgarciac2021/wiki), since there is info of everything involved on this project. From the [RGB color model](https://github.com/clases-julio/p2-gpio-ledrgb-dgarciac2021/wiki/RGB) to the [RGB LED](https://github.com/clases-julio/p2-gpio-ledrgb-dgarciac2021/wiki/RGB-LED).

## Circuit Assembly

The assembly is pretty straight-forward, just like [the previous one](https://github.com/clases-julio/p1-introrpi-pwm-dgarciac2021) but repeated three times. However, this time we are using a fixed value of Î© for each color (XX for **R**ed and YY for **G**reen and **B**lue)

This is an schematic made with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/):

And this is the real circuit!

## Code

## Circuit testing

This is the result! Pretty nice, isn't it?
